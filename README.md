# SuRE-raQTL-scripts

This repos contains scripts and data associated with the manuscript "J. van Arensbergen et al:
Systematic identification of human SNPs affecting regulatory element activity." 

These are scripts and small data files used to generate the lists of raQTLs. The scripts are used as follows:
1. `downsampling_reformatting_normalizing_combining_SuRE-counts_LP190327.R`
   extracts and reformats relevant data from the SuRE-counts data files, which
   are generated by the preprocessing pipeline (see
   (github)[https://github.com/lpagie/SuRE-variants-pipeline/tree/56081b1c795c69b72801dac35c3ab334a1a3028b]).\\
   This script uses the accompanying data files from this repos for downsampling some of the input data files.
2. `size_reduction_SuRE-count_files_JvA190328.R` reduces the size of the data
   files generated in the first step.
3. `wilcox_analysis_and_dataframe_construction_JvA190328.R` performs the actual
   statistical testing and filtering.
